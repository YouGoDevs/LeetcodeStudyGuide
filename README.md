# Leetcode Study Guide


## Prerequisite Knowledge
- What is an array, matrix, linked list, hash table?
  - For each of these, what happens when you add, remove, and select an item?
- What is a stack, heap, graph, and tree?
  - Know the time complexity for adding, removing, and selecting an item
- Big-O notation
  - Time and space complexity. 
  - For example, a “for” loop takes O(n) time; an array takes O(n) space.
- Sorting algorithms
  - Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort
  - Know and understand how they work
  - Know the time and space complexity for each

## Study Guide
Taken from [Danny’s Discord group](https://discord.com/channels/739845668582981683/739845892579786822/942949178055733298) & slightly modified.

**Consistency.** These problems are conceptually difficult and take time for our brains to digest. Doing 1 problem a day for a month is superior to doing 30 problems in 3 days. Also, focus on learning the problem-solving techniques, rather than memorizing specific problems.

**Practice problems on CodeWars/HackerRank/TopCoder/Project Euler/LeetCode/etc/etc.** This is super-common advice. But that's because it's good advice. However, it's also just the start...

**Start with the basics.** Before even starting with LeetCode, understand the basic data structures and algorithms. Arrays, linked lists, hash tables: How do they work and what happens when you add, remove, or look for an item? How do sorting algorithms work (bubble sort, merge sort, etc)? Once you learn these, do the Easy problems in various categories, then once you can do those in about 5 minutes, do Medium. You probably won't ever need Hard in your life.

**RTFM.** Read the docs/spec for your programming language of choice. Learn how common data structures are implemented. Learn how libraries are implemented. Learn default settings and how they might affect performance. The more expertise you have in your chosen language, the more impressed your interviewers will be. **Note: Most interviews today are done in Python, because it is concise and easy to learn.**

**Practice thinking out loud.** While you're doing coding problems, practice explaining your approach (out loud). Explain why you're making the choices you are and why you're not making other choices.

**Practice iterating on your solution.** Once you solve a problem, before you look at others' solutions, look at your own solution with a critical eye. How could it be made "better"? Could it be made more readable? More efficient? Shorter? Better organized? Better variable names? Lots of these work against each other, so play around with different paths and see what feels best to you. Practice justifying your choices out loud.

**Read others' solutions.** Once you submit your solution, most sites will show you other users' solutions. Don't just go to the next problem. Spend at least a few minutes reading others' solutions and understanding them. Think of whether their solution is better or worse than yours. 

**Practice coding without an IDE.** Stay away from the "run my code" button when solving problems if you can. Be 90% sure your code will run properly before you submit.

**Come up with test cases.** One way to be confident your code will work is to run through a test case (again, out loud). Pick test data that's short enough to get through in <5 minutes, but still exercises each branch of your code. Use multiple simple cases when needed.

**Analyze the runtime of your solution.** Most companies will expect you to provide a big-O analysis of your code (both time and space complexity). It's a huge area of study, but if you can gain an understanding of it, it'll unlock doors for you.

**Time yourself.** Once you've done a few problems, simulate the time pressure in an interview. Most interviews will require you to completely finish the problem in about 30 minutes. Keep checking the clock to make sure you're pacing yourself properly.
